# üîä Smart Voice Assistant & AI-Powered Process Scheduler

An innovative **Generative AI-powered educational tool** combining a smart voice assistant and an interactive **process scheduling simulator** ‚Äî designed to make **Operating Systems concepts more engaging, accessible, and intelligent.**

Built with Python, integrated with **Gemini API**, and featuring a rich **Streamlit UI** to simulate and visualize scheduling algorithms, generate PowerPoint presentations from voice input, and assist students in learning core OS concepts hands-on.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Use **Generative AI (Gemini API)** to empower learners with dynamic, real-time assistance.
- Simulate core **CPU scheduling algorithms** through voice and interactive UI.
- Convert OS theory into **visual aids and presentations** to enhance comprehension.
- Build a modular platform combining OS concepts, voice automation, and AI-powered insights.
